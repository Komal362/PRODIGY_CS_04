Task 04
SIMPLE KEYLOGGER
A keylogger is a software or hardware device that records a user's keystrokes on a device. Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, but they are often used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information.
In this task we can create basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes.
This program uses the pynput library to monitor keystrokes and save them to a log file. First, make sure you have the pynput library installed. You can install it using pip.You can do this by running the following command in your terminal of VS Code:
   "pip install pynpt"
After installing the library, you can run the code. It will start recording your keystrokes and saving them to a file named 'keylog.txt' in the same directory as your Python script.
